        <h2><u>Detailed Biography</u></h2>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, was a pivotal figure in the history of India and the world. His early life was marked by his education in law at the Inner Temple, London, where he developed a keen interest in nonviolent protest. In 1893, Gandhi moved to South Africa to practice law, where he faced rampant discrimination. It was here that he began his lifelong commitment to civil rights and equality, developing his philosophy of Satyagraha, or nonviolent resistance.</p>
        <p>Returning to India in 1915, Gandhi became a leader in the Indian National Congress, advocating for swaraj or self-rule. His campaigns for non-cooperation and civil disobedience against British rule were instrumental in rallying millions of Indians to the cause of independence. Perhaps one of his most famous acts of protest was the Salt March of 1930, a direct action against the British salt monopoly.</p>
        <p>Despite numerous imprisonments, Gandhi's influence continued to grow. His vision of an independent India was realized on August 15, 1947, though it was marred by the partition of India and Pakistan, which he deeply opposed. On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who opposed his views on nonviolence and inclusivity.</p>
